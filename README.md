# genmo
This code generates a video sequence by painting moving sprites onto a moving background image. Ground truth motion field, motion boundary and occluded regions from any frame to any other frame can also be generated. The generated test data can be very useful for video coding, video enhancement as well as various computer vision tasks. The code uses OpenCV library.
